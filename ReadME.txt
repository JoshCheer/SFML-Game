This is SFML basic game I made to use as a sample project to show my modern C++ 20 skills and knowledge making use of OOP, encapsulation and other principles

The game is a basic maze game walking into the cat and you "WIN" and will be taken
back to the home screen

controls are W,A,S,D

this is a 32bit project

None of the visual Assets are my own they are all either self created or licenced for free.

Thanks Josh Cheer
